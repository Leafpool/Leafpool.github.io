		     <h1> How can we help? </h1>

		     <p> Thanks to humans Arctic Animals are threatened by gloabal warming. Pollution caused a "blanket" to form in the atmosphere. When heat comes into out atmosphere in the form of sun rays, it is very hard for it to escape because of the "blanket." This heat is melting glaciers and ice very fast, where most Arctic animals live. We can help by not polluting, which will keep these animals alive.</p>
